# Multi-Disease-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning

 

This project is a **machine learning-based disease prediction system** that analyzes **user-reported symptoms** to classify potential diseases using **multiple supervised learning algorithms**. The system utilizes **Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Logistic Regression**, ensuring **high accuracy and reliable predictions**.

### **🔍 Features:**  
✅ **Multi-Disease Classification** – Predicts multiple diseases based on symptom input.  
✅ **Machine Learning Models** – Uses **ensemble learning, feature selection, and cross-validation** for improved accuracy.  
✅ **User-Friendly Web Interface** – Developed using **Flask**, allowing users to enter symptoms easily.  
✅ **Healthcare Recommendations** – Provides **medications, precautions, dietary suggestions, and workout plans** based on predicted diseases.  
✅ **Scalable & Cost-Effective** – Can be integrated into **telemedicine platforms** or used as an **AI-powered diagnostic tool**.

### **🛠️ Technologies Used:**  
🔹 **Python** (Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy)  
🔹 **Flask** (Web Framework)  
🔹 **Machine Learning Algorithms** (SVM, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, KNN, Logistic Regression)  
🔹 **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** (For UI Development)  
🔹 **Medical Datasets** (Kaggle-based symptom-disease mappings)  

---

### **📌 How It Works:**  
1️⃣ **User inputs symptoms** via a web interface.  
2️⃣ **ML models analyze symptom patterns** and predict the disease.  
3️⃣ The system **provides a description of the disease**, along with **recommended medications, precautions, and diet plans**.  
4️⃣ Users receive **instant diagnostic insights**, helping in **early detection and prevention**.

### **🚀 Future Enhancements:**  
🔸 Integration with **wearable health monitoring devices**.  
🔸 Use of **Deep Learning (CNNs/RNNs) for advanced medical predictions**.  
🔸 Addition of **real-time patient data for improved accuracy**.  
🔸 Expansion to support **more diseases and multilingual capabilities**.
